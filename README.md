Data
----

Cave Game Tracker collects certain data and sends it to a database. 

What kind of data? It sends your wolf/sheep's id, your wolf/sheep's pack, and your coordinates array. 

This data is only accessible to those actively developing Cave Game Tracker. Cave Game Tracker does not collect any sensitive/personal data, only the data listed above.

This data is being planned to be used in future versions of the Cave Game Tracker to assist users in avoiding pathways that have already been stepped on by other users.
